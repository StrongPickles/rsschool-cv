## Summary

I have devoted 8 years to graphic design, prepress and printing processes. Now I hold the position of the head of the printing department and realized that routine, lack of career and professional growth oppress me.
I chose the JS / Front-end development direction, looking at the example of my fellow programmers - every day they solve interesting problems and learn something new. In addition, my experience in design should complement the knowledge gained in training front-end development.
